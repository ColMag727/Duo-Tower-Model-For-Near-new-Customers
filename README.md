# Duo Tower Model for Near-new Customers

This repository contains a **dual-tower machine learning pipeline** designed to predict:

- **Withdrawal Intention (WTR)** – whether a customer is likely to withdraw after repayment  
- **Credit Line Utilization (CLU)** – whether a customer will use more than 50% of their available credit line  

The project targets **near-new customers** (customers with limited loan history), using millions of loan-level records and thousands of features to build robust and interpretable models.
